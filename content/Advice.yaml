      It’s been proven that a weighted cover can lower cortisol levels (the stress hormone) 
      due to the applied low pressure, creating a feeling of relaxation and well-being. It also promotes 
      production of the happiness hormone - serotonin and the sleep hormone - melatonin. The reduction in 
      cortisol and increase in serotonin and melatonin combine to make your muscles and nervous system relax 
      making you feel comforted and cosseted which can help send you to sleep and keep you asleep.

      Your score suggests you are not looking after your mental wellness are most likely suffering 
      from an anxiety disorder. You should not take this as a diagnosis of any sort, or a recommendation

      from a trained mental health professional soon to rule out a possible anxiety disorder. 
      
      The deep pressure provided by a weighted cover can help reduce the physiological arousal associated 
      with anxiety by triggering a switch from “fight or flight” to “rest and digest” helping you to 
      control the situation, feel calmer and more in control.
      
      A weighted blanket can boost serotonin and melatonin levels and reduce cortisol, helping you cope better with your emotions and feel more relaxed.
      
      This is not a diagnostic quiz or professional assessment, however, so please don’t take these 
      quiz results as a recommendation for treatment. However, you may find it beneficial to talk 
      about your symptoms with your doctor or a mental health professional (such as a psychologist). 
      Only a properly trained physician or professional can diagnose a sleep or anxiety concern.
