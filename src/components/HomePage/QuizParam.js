        You could benefit from using a weighted blanket as part of your
        night-time routine. Using a weighted blanket during the hour before
        going to bed can promote the production of the sleep hormone –
        melatonin, preparing you for the night ahead.

        If you are having trouble sleeping, it’s a good idea to get yourself
        into a bedtime routine. This should involve relaxing and unwinding,
        particularly turning off technology and maybe reading a book instead. A
        warm caffeine free drink or warm bath can also help.

        It sounds like you’re not getting the quality of sleep your body needs.
        With the help of a weighted cover, sleep can be improved. It’s been
        proven that a weighted cover can lower cortisol levels (the stress
        hormone) due to the applied low pressure, creating a feeling of
        relaxation and well-being. It also promotes production of the happiness
        hormone - serotonin and the sleep hormone - melatonin. The reduction in
        cortisol and increase in serotonin and melatonin combine to make your
        muscles and nervous system relax making you feel comforted and cosseted
        which can help send you to sleep and keep you asleep.

        Many of us have trouble controlling our temperature a night. This could
        be down to a physiological condition, such as the menopause or could
        simply be down to your bedroom being too hot or cold. The ideal
        temperature for the bedroom is about 16 – 18 °C. It’s also a good idea
        to have an open window so that the air can circulate. Some weighted
        blankets on the market are very warm because they are padded, like a
        duvet and the weight is produced by plastic beads. Our weighted blankets
        are not padded, and the weight is produced by chromium alloy micro-beads
        which have a low specific heat capacity which means they do not retain
        heat.

        During sleep, your body is hard at work: renewing cells, healing and
        processing your day. Not only how long you sleep but also the quality of
        sleep is important. Restless sleep and constant waking interrupts these
        processes, reducing your concentration and performance the next day.
        With the help of a weighted cover, sleep can be improved, and these
        processes revived.

        Most of us would agree that some situations can be stressful, but for
        some these situations can grow out of proportion and result in anxiety
        and panic attacks. These can be accompanied by symptoms such as
        dizziness, palpitations, and inability to think clearly. The deep
        pressure provided by a weighted cover can help reduce the physiological
        arousal associated with anxiety by triggering a switch from “fight or
        flight” to “rest and digest” helping you to control the situation, feel
        calmer and more in control.

        Occupational therapists have long used weighted blankets to help
        children with sensory issues and anxiety, including ADHD. A weighted
        blanket can boost serotonin and melatonin levels and reduce cortisol,
        helping you cope better with your emotions and feel more relaxed.

        As a shift worker you’re very likely to be disrupting your circadian
        rhythm, the 24-hour internal clock running in the background that cycles
        between sleepiness and alertness at regular intervals.
